# Series Management | a React and Express Web App

Series management is a ReactJS and ExpressJS fullstack web app I made for a friend.

It's a private application with just one user, protected by a password only known by him and me.

## **Features**
- JWT authentication made from scratch.
- Login persistance using refresh tokens.
- Protected routing.

## **Stack**
- Typescript, React, Express, Axios and Prisma.

### Back-end is being hosted on **Heroku** while the front-end on **Vercel**.

## **Backstory**

A friend of mine asked if i could build a interface so he could interact with a database.

He's hosting a postgres database that stores all tv shows he's watching or already watched.

This app works like a crud linked to this database.

### **It was a great opportunity to practice my software developing skills, front-end and backend.**

## **Future Plans and Improvement**

> - **Containerize** front-end and backend. I've already done this with the backend though, but i'm looking for a place to host it.
> - Test it out on **Kubernetes**, GKE or Minikube.
> - Try other backend solutions like **FastAPI** with python.
> - Implement loading spinners and confirmation.
> - Improve desktop experience.
> - Build future apps using **NextJs**.
> - Try **OAuth** and **Auth0**.
